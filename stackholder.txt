>>> Steps which will be using while solving data 

1>>Problem Statement = Visualization of Company Stakeholder

>> 1st step: we need to import the libraries 
           >> import pandas
	   >> import numpy
	   >> import matplotlib
           >> import seabird 
>> 2nd step: after importing the libraries then we have to store the data into the variable so that file can easily the data
           << once the data stored into the variable then we have to read the data using pd.read_csv (){in parenthesis we have to
              implement one argument (i.e. the variable where we had storied the data.
           << in next step we stored the new variable called loan_status from here we are counting the value using value_counts()
>> 3rd step: Ploting the bar graph
           << as we already import our libraries, so by using those libraries we are plotting the bar graph.
           << basis step (plt.bar(){inside parenthesis we need to provide the 2 argument(for x & y axis)
 	      giving the title to graph using (plt.title("name of title") for x axis name (plt.xlabel("x axis name")
	      for y axis name (plt.ylabel("y axis name"), if you implement grid then use (plt.grid(True){True argument shows the
	      grid lines, False argument does not show grid lines})
              fianlly plt.show(), then we able to see your graph 
	   << To change bar color use (plt.bar(2 argument, color="name of the color")

>>>>Things to ponder upon:

  - Company has more 'loan approvals' or 'loan disapprovals'?

	<<< To find whether loan approval is more or loan disapproval, we named 2 factors "Yes" & "No"  
            <<>> The graph represents number of people whose loan approval is more, now the question comes why are they having more numbers??
                 ...ones you applied to loan, then your representative bank analysis your bank account, check your credit score if your score is
		    good enough then the bank will be processed for a Documentation check, and further your loan gets approved.
 	   <<>> Those who are not applicable mean those whose loan is disapproved they are not eligible or their credit score is low. 
  - Can one of the company's health factors be its loan status distribution?
	   <<>> its hard to say the company have to check with financial sector, there are 4 critical areas of financial 
	         <. Liquidity 
	         <. solvency 
	         <. Profitability
	         <. Operating efficiency
                 <. Bottom Line

<<<< Everyone needs money 
    >>>> here stakeholder want to see in which region have highest no. of loan approval & lower no. loan approval
	<<< by using "groupby" we can extract data from 'property_area' and 'loan_status'
            {groupby is used when we have to extract the data from column names, aggregate functions, constants and expressions.}
	<<< Plotting unstack bar (stack = false ) . plt(kind = 'bar',stack = false,color = '', figsize = (,)
             {figsize = here need to give 2 values for complete bar which representslength and height of bar}
	<<< the remaining portion for plotting is we can change the bar color, name the title (plt.title = ""), name x & y axis(plt.xlabel& plt.ylabel)
	<<< to rotate the name(plt.xtrick (in xtrick x is x axis) plt.xtrick(rotation = degree)

<<<<Things to ponder upon
<<<<<>>>>>>- Which is the region with the highest no. of loan approvals? lowest no. of loan approvals?
		<<>> To visualize the highest no. loan approval & lowest no. loan approval in region like <. urban <. semiurban <.rural
			<<>> As comapred to 3 region the highest no. loan approval in semiurban region (175) and lowest no. of loan approval is also semiurban region (51)  
													
<<<<<>>>>>>- Which is the region with the maximum difference between loan approvals and loan rejections?
		<<>> As its clearly shown in graph the semiurban region is the region where we had found the maximum diff between loan approval and loan rejection. (175-51 = 124)


<<<< Expensive Education
    >>>> here stakeholder want to know by which group (graduate or non graduate)  applied for loan.
	<<< by using "groupby" we can extract data from 'education' and 'loan_status'
            {groupby is used when we have to extract the data from column names, aggregate functions, constants and expressions.}
	<<< Plotting unstack bar (stack = True ) . plt(kind = 'bar',stack = True,color = '', figsize = (,){figsize = here need to give 2 values for complete bar which represent 
	    length and height of bar}
	<<< the remaining portion for plotting is we can change the bar color, name the title (plt.title = ""), name x & y axis(plt.xlabel& plt.ylabel)
	<<< to rotate the name(plt.xtrick (in xtrick x is x axis) plt.xtrick(rotation = degree)

<<<<<Things to ponder upon (Higher education has always been an expensive endeavour for people but it results in better career opportunities and stability in life. 
                            But does higher education result in a better guarantee in issuing loans?)
<<<<<>>>>- Overall which group has asked for higher loan services irrespective of the approval? Graduate or Non-Graduate?
	 <<>> irrespective of approe knval the graduate are applied for more loan than non - graduates 
<<<<<>>>>- Which group has had better approval to non-approval ratio? Graduate or Non-Graduate?
	 <<>> the non-graduates have better approval to non-approval ration than graduates. 

<<<<>>>>Do the above conclusions make sense? Why?
	>>>... If we talk about the education, in todays era we can differentite education into 2 parts
               >. The Eduaction which people can afford >. Higher education ( Some people cant afford but they find a way to grab knowledge)
		   Education is same everywhere but the way of teaching, atmosphere, infrastructure, portpolio of organisation, getting job ration from the organization the factor 
		   may differ from normal education and higher education.
	       >. if we talk about career opportunities from higher studies i think it partially depend upon the yourself and the college or university, by the end your performance will speck
		  good college or university will also create impact on your carrier.
	       >. In this scenrio the graduates applied for higher loan service, most of the have graduates applied for education loan etc.(the graduates are applied for higher studies are most of the 
                  higher studies are expensive) and non-graduates in this factor( it depends on stackholders which type are people 
		  they are considering in the non-graduates catogries)

<<<<< Smater and Richer
	>>>> Here we need to check the being graduate or not also leads to different loan amount distribution with the help of overlapping Density plot.
		<<< first we are subsetting the dataframe based on 'Education' column for Graduate and Not Graduate. 

<<<<>>>>Things to ponder upon
<<<<<>>>>- Do Graduate people get approved a higher amount than their Non Graduate counterparts?
	>>>.. ????
<<<<<>>>>- What's the average amount of loan approved for Graduate? for Non-Graduate? Is there a huge difference between the two? 
	>>>...????


<<<<<<  Income vs Loan
	we need to understand the correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he is lent with the help of graph
	<.> for this  we are making 3 scatter plots(ax_1,ax_2,ax_3) 'Applicant Income','Coapplicant Income','Total Income' vs 'Loan Amount'
	<<.>>scatter plot is used to show the relationship between 2 variable.

<<<<<>>>>>>Things to ponder upon
<<<<<<>>>>>>- Is there a correlation between 'ApplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount'?(One way to know that is looking at the line formed when you connect the scatter plot dots?)

<<<>>>>>- Is the 'TotalIncome' better related to the 'LoanAmount' than 'ApplicantIncome'?
		<<>> Yes if we compare the both scatter plots we can say that Total income is better than applicant income
